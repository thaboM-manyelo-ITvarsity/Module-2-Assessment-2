        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        <p>In 1976, an 11-year-old Gru dreams to become a supervillain, assisted by the Minions, whom he has hired to work for him. Gru is ecstatic when he receives an audition invitation from the Vicious 6, 
            a supervillain team led by Belle Bottom, who hope to find a new member to replace their founder, the supervillain Wild Knuckles, following their betrayal and the presumed death of Knuckles during a heist to steal the Zodiac Stone â€“ a stone connected to the Chinese zodiac. 
            Due to his young age, Gru's interview goes poorly but, much to the outrage of the Vicious 6, he manages to steal the stone and escapes with Minions Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, handing the stone to another Minion, Otto, for safekeeping.</p>
