                    <p>The Pick n Pay Group is a retail business in the fast-moving consumer goods industry. 
                        The Group operates through multiple store formats under three brands â€“ Pick n Pay, Boxer and TM Supermarkets. 
                        Pick n Pay also operates one of the largest online grocery platforms in sub-Saharan Africa. 
                        Raymond Ackerman purchased the first four Pick n Pay stores in Cape Town, South Africa, in 1967 from Jack Goldin.[4] 
                        Since then, the Group has grown to encompass stores across South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Nigeria, Eswatini and Lesotho. Pick n Pay also owns a 49% share of Zimbabwean supermarket chain, TM Supermarkets.[5</p>
